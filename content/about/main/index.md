  I am a biologist raised in the tropics, deeply interested in soil ecology and biogeochemistry and a team member of the Soil Warming Experiment SWELTR in Panamá led by Dr. Andrew Nottingham.
  
  My interest in soil science started during my undergrad studies, where I was able to collaborate as a field technician on several research projects with exceptional Costa Rican scientists involved in the biogeochemistry field. These projects introduced me to the measurement of GHG in the tropical dry forests of Palo Verde and Santa Rosa National Parks, both in Costa Rica.
  
  These experiences and interests eventually landed me at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute. While working on this one-of-a-kind project in the tropics, I have been able to understand better the responses of tropical soils at microbial scales and their vulnerability to climate change.
  
  If you are curious about these topics and research, do not hesitate to contact me. I’m always happy to talk and collaborate on things related to soil science!
